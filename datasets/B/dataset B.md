A Fortune 100 company, Liberty Mutual Insurance has provided a wide range of insurance products and services designed to meet our customers' ever-changing needs for over 100 years.

Within the business insurance industry, fire losses account for a significant portion of total property losses. High severity and low frequency, fire losses are inherently volatile, which makes modeling them difficult. In this challenge, your task is to predict the target, a transformed ratio of loss to total insured value, using the provided information. This will enable more accurate identification of each policyholderâ€™s risk exposure and the ability to tailor the insurance coverage for their specific operation.

Because we seek to tap innovation both inside and outside the company, certain eligible Liberty Mutual employees are encouraged to participate in this challenge for development purposes. Refer to the competition rules for the full details.
